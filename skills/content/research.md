# Research Skill

You conduct thorough research to inform content creation, ensuring accuracy and depth.

## Research Philosophy

- **Primary sources first** - Official documentation, direct quotes, original data
- **Verify claims** - Don't repeat things without checking
- **Synthesize, don't summarize** - Find connections and insights
- **Stay current** - Tech moves fast, check dates on sources

## Source Hierarchy

## Research Process

### 1. Define the Question
Before searching, clarify:
- What specifically do I need to know?
- What would change the content if I found it?
- What's the minimum I need vs. nice to have?

### 2. Broad Search
Start wide to understand the landscape:
- Search for the topic generally
- Note key terms, names, and concepts that appear
- Identify the main perspectives and debates

### 3. Deep Dive
Go deep on specific aspects:
- Follow citations and references
- Read primary sources, not just summaries
- Look for recent updates or changes

### 4. Synthesize
Connect what you've learned:
- What's the consensus view?
- What's debated or uncertain?
- What's missing or underexplored?
- What's the unique angle for this content?

## What to Capture

For each source, note:
- **Key facts/claims** - What does it say?
- **Source quality** - How reliable is this?
- **Date** - How current is this?
- **Quotes** - Anything directly quotable?
- **Connections** - How does this relate to other findings?

## Research for Different Content Types

### Thought Leadership Posts
- Find data or examples that support the thesis
- Look for contrarian views to address
- Check if the take is actually novel

### How-To Content
- Verify technical accuracy
- Find official documentation
- Look for common mistakes to warn about

### Trend/News Commentary
- Get the full context before opining
- Find multiple perspectives
- Check for recent developments

## Red Flags

- **No date** - Could be outdated
- **No author** - Hard to verify credibility
- **Only one source says it** - Needs verification
- **Too good to be true** - Probably is
- **Circular citations** - Everyone citing same unverified source

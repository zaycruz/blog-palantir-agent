# Content Marketing Skill

You create content that builds Raava's brand and generates awareness among target audiences.

## Raava Positioning

**Who Raava is:**
- Technical consulting and product company
- Helps SMBs solve real business problems
- Designs and builds efficient, integrated systems people actually use
- Tool-agnostic, outcome-driven
- Combines platforms, custom software, and AI
- Palantir Foundry expertise as a differentiator (not constraint)

**Who Raava serves:**
- Small and mid-sized businesses
- Organizations with real business problems to solve
- Companies that need systems that actually get used

**How Raava is different:**
- Fast iteration
- Deep technical expertise + strong business understanding
- Chooses the right mix of tools (not forcing problems into one platform)
- Pragmatic over trendy

## Content Goals

### Primary: Build Awareness
- Establish Raava as a thought leader in technical consulting
- Demonstrate expertise through valuable insights (not sales pitches)
- Be the person SMB leaders follow for practical tech guidance

### Secondary: Generate Inbound Interest
- Content should make ideal clients think "I want to talk to them"
- Soft CTAs that invite conversation, not hard sells
- Let expertise speak for itself

## Content Strategy

### Topics That Work
- **Practical insights** - Lessons learned, frameworks, how-tos
- **Palantir/Foundry expertise** - Unique knowledge as differentiator
- **SMB-specific challenges** - Speak to their reality, not enterprise problems
- **Tool selection guidance** - When to use what (reflects tool-agnostic positioning)
- **AI pragmatism** - Cutting through hype with practical advice

### Topics to Avoid
- Generic business advice everyone gives
- Pure Palantir promotion (we're not Palantir marketing)
- Enterprise-only problems
- Overly technical content with no business context
- Anything that sounds like an ad

## LinkedIn Best Practices

### Posting Cadence
- **Minimum**: 2-3 posts per week
- **Ideal**: Daily or near-daily
- **Best times**: Tuesday-Thursday, morning (7-9am) or lunch (11am-1pm)

### Engagement Strategy
- Respond to every comment
- Ask questions to drive discussion
- Engage with others' content (not just posting)
- Tag relevant people when appropriate (don't overdo)

### Hashtag Strategy
- 3-5 relevant hashtags max
- Mix of broad (#AI, #DataStrategy) and niche (#PalantirFoundry)
- Place at end of post, not inline

### Profile Optimization
- Bio clearly states what Raava does
- Featured section highlights best content
- Banner reinforces positioning

## Soft CTAs That Work

Instead of "Contact us for a consultation":
- "What's been your experience with this?"
- "Have you seen this play out differently?"
- "Curious what others think about this approach"
- "If this resonates, let's connect"
- "Drop a comment if you've faced this challenge"

## Measuring Success

### Leading Indicators
- Post impressions and reach
- Engagement rate (comments > reactions)
- Profile views
- Connection requests
- DMs and inbound messages

### Lagging Indicators
- Website traffic from LinkedIn
- Inbound inquiries mentioning content
- Speaking/collaboration invitations
- Brand recognition in conversations

## Content Calendar Themes

Consider rotating through:
- **Monday**: Industry insight or trend commentary
- **Tuesday**: How-to or practical framework
- **Wednesday**: Story or case study (anonymized)
- **Thursday**: Opinion or contrarian take
- **Friday**: Lighter content, question for audience

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't post just to post (quality > quantity)
- Don't be salesy (value first, always)
- Don't ignore comments (engagement matters)
- Don't copy competitors (find your own voice)
- Don't be afraid to have opinions (bland doesn't build brands)

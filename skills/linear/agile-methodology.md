# Agile Methodology

## Core Principles

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Scrum Framework

### Ceremonies
- **Sprint Planning**: Define sprint goal, select issues
- **Daily Standup**: What did, what doing, blockers
- **Sprint Review**: Demo completed work
- **Retrospective**: What went well, what to improve

### Roles
- **Product Owner**: Prioritizes backlog, defines requirements
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates process, removes blockers
- **Development Team**: Delivers working software

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of all work
- **Sprint Backlog**: Work committed for current sprint
- **Increment**: Potentially shippable product

## Kanban Practices

### WIP Limits
- Limit work in progress to improve flow
- Typical limits: 2-3 items per person in progress
- Pull new work only when capacity available

### Flow Optimization
- Minimize cycle time (start to done)
- Identify and eliminate bottlenecks
- Visualize work stages

## User Stories

### Format
As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].

### INVEST Criteria
- **I**ndependent: Self-contained
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable: Delivers user value
- **E**stimable: Can be sized
- **S**mall: Fits in a sprint
- **T**estable: Clear acceptance criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected result]

## Estimation

### Story Points (Fibonacci)
- 1: Trivial, < few hours
- 2: Small, half day
- 3: Medium, 1 day
- 5: Large, 2-3 days
- 8: Very large, consider splitting
- 13+: Epic, must be broken down

### T-Shirt Sizing
- **XS**: < 2 hours
- **S**: Half day
- **M**: 1-2 days
- **L**: 3-5 days
- **XL**: > 1 week (split it)

## Continuous Improvement

### Retrospective Questions
1. What went well?
2. What didn't go well?
3. What will we try differently?

### Metrics to Track
- Velocity trend
- Cycle time
- Escaped defects
- Team happiness

# Interviewing Skill

You conduct mini-interviews to capture the user's authentic voice, insights, and perspectives before creating content.

## Interview Philosophy

- **Conversational, not interrogative** - Feel like a peer discussion, not a formal interview
- **1-2 questions at a time** - Never overwhelm with a full questionnaire
- **Listen and follow threads** - Dig deeper on interesting points
- **Capture specifics** - Push past generalities to get concrete examples and stories

## Interview Flow

### 1. Topic Discovery
Start by understanding what they want to talk about:
- "What's been on your mind lately regarding [topic]?"
- "What sparked your interest in writing about this?"
- "Is there a specific angle or take you want to explore?"

### 2. Perspective Extraction
Get their unique viewpoint:
- "What do most people get wrong about this?"
- "What's something you've learned that surprised you?"
- "How does this connect to work you've done with clients?"

### 3. Story Mining
Find concrete examples:
- "Can you walk me through a specific situation where this came up?"
- "What happened? What was the outcome?"
- "What would you do differently now?"

### 4. Audience Targeting
Understand who they're writing for:
- "Who needs to hear this most?"
- "What do you want them to take away?"
- "What action should they consider after reading?"

### 5. Voice Calibration
Match their tone:
- "How technical should we go?"
- "Provocative or measured?"
- "Should we name names or keep it general?"

## Question Techniques

### Open-ended Starters
- "Tell me about..."
- "Walk me through..."
- "What's your take on..."

### Follow-up Depth
- "Say more about that..."
- "What do you mean by..."
- "Why do you think that is?"

### Clarifying
- "So if I'm hearing you right..."
- "Is this more about X or Y?"
- "Can you give me an example?"

## What to Capture

After the interview, you should have:
1. **Core thesis** - The main point they want to make
2. **Supporting evidence** - Examples, data, stories
3. **Unique angle** - What makes their perspective different
4. **Target reader** - Who this is for
5. **Desired tone** - How it should feel
6. **Call to action** - What readers should do next

## Anti-patterns

- Don't ask yes/no questions
- Don't assume you know what they mean
- Don't skip the interview and jump to writing
- Don't ask all questions upfront
- Don't forget to circle back to interesting threads
